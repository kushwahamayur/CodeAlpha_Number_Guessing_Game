Task:- Number Guessing Game

This C++ program runs a guessing game with the following steps:

1. A random number is generated between 1 and 100.

2. The player is asked to guess the number.

3. The game gives feedback (too high, too low, or correct).

4. The loop continues until the player guesses correctly.

5. The program tracks the number of attempts and prints the result once the player guesses correctly.

The game also includes input validation, ensuring the user enters a valid number each time.
